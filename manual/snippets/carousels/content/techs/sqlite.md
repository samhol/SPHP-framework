### SQLite <small>DBMS</small>

  **SQLite** is a relational database management system. **SQLite** is not a clientâ€“server 
  database engine. Rather, it is embedded into the end program. It is ACID-compliant 
  and implements most of the SQL standard.

  **SQLite** is a popular choice as embedded database software for local/client storage 
  in application software such as web browsers. It is arguably the most widely 
  deployed database engine, as it is used today by several widespread browsers, 
  operating systems, and embedded systems (such as mobile phones), among others. 
  **SQLite** has bindings to many programming languages like PHP.
