### Sass <small>stylesheet language</small>

Sass is an extension of CSS that adds power and elegance to the basic 
language. It allows you to use variables, nested rules, mixins, inline 
imports, and more, all with a fully CSS-compatible syntax. Sass helps keep 
large stylesheets well-organized, and get small stylesheets up and running 
quickly, particularly with the help of the Compass style library.
