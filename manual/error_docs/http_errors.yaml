300:
  type: redirection
  message: Multiple Choices
  description: Indicates multiple options for the resource from which the client may choose (via agent-driven content negotiation). For example, this code could be used to present multiple video format options, to list files with different filename extensions, or to suggest word-sense disambiguation.[19]
301:
  type: redirection
  message: Moved Permanently
  description: This and all future requests should be directed to the given URI.[20]
302:
  type: redirection
  message: Found
  description: This is an example of industry practice contradicting the standard. The HTTP/1.0 specification (RFC 1945) required the client to perform a temporary redirect (the original describing phrase was "Moved Temporarily"),[21] but popular browsers implemented 302 with the functionality of a 303 See Other. Therefore, HTTP/1.1 added status codes 303 and 307 to distinguish between the two behaviours.[22] However, some Web applications and frameworks use the 302 status code as if it were the 303.[23]
303:
  type: redirection
  message: See Other
  description: The response to the request can be found under another URI using a GET method. When received in response to a POST (or PUT/DELETE), the client should presume that the server has received the data and should issue a redirect with a separate GET message.[24]
304:
  type: redirection
  message: Not Modified
  description: Indicates that the resource has not been modified since the version specified by the request headers If-Modified-Since or If-None-Match. In such case, there is no need to retransmit the resource since the client still has a previously-downloaded copy.[25]
305:
  type: redirection
  message: Use Proxy
  description: The requested resource is available only through a proxy, the address for which is provided in the response. Many HTTP clients (such as Mozilla[26] and Internet Explorer) do not correctly handle responses with this status code, primarily for security reasons.[27]
306:
  type: redirection
  message: Switch Proxy
  description: No longer used. Originally meant "Subsequent requests should use the specified proxy."[28]
307:
  type: redirection
  message: Temporary Redirect
  description: In this case, the request should be repeated with another URI; however, future requests should still use the original URI. In contrast to how 302 was historically implemented, the request method is not allowed to be changed when reissuing the original request. For example, a POST request should be repeated using another POST request.[29]
308:
  type: redirection
  message: Permanent Redirect (RFC 7538)
  description: The request and all future requests should be repeated using another URI. 307 and 308 parallel the behaviors of 302 and 301, but do not allow the HTTP method to change. So, for example, submitting a form to a permanently redirected resource may continue smoothly.[30]
