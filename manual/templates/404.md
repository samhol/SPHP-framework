The **404** or **Not Found** error message is a Hypertext Transfer Protocol 
(HTTP) standard response code, in computer network communications, to indicate 
that the client was able to communicate with a given server, but the server 
could not find what was requested.

The web site hosting server will typically generate a "**404** Not Found" web 
page when a user attempts to follow a broken or dead link; hence the **404** 
error is one of the most recognizable errors encountered on the World Wide Web.
