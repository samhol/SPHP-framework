[![Travis CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/avalanche123/Imagine.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/avalanche123/Imagine) [![AppVeyor Build Status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/avalanche123/Imagine?branch=develop&svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/avalanche123/Imagine)

Imagine is an open source image manipulation library built with `PHP 5.3` that 
implements an object oriented interface to ImageMagick, GraphicsMagick and GD.  
It provides functionality for both common image manipulation and drawing tasks.  
Instead of rewriting the same code to create a thumbnail, crop, rotate, resize, 
flip or even creating a composite image, Imagine provides a single line method 
to solve these tasks.
