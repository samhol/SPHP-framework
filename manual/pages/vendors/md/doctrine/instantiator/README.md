# Instantiator [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/doctrine/instantiator.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/doctrine/instantiator)

This library provides a way of avoiding usage of constructors when instantiating PHP classes.

## Credits

This library was migrated from [ocramius/instantiator](https://github.com/Ocramius/Instantiator), which
has been donated to the doctrine organization, and which is now deprecated in favour of this package.
