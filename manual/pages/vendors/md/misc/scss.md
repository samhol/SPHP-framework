# Sass [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sass/ruby-sass.svg?branch=next)](https://travis-ci.org/sass/ruby-sass)

Sass makes CSS fun again. Sass is an extension of CSS, adding nested rules, variables, 
mixins, selector inheritance, and more. It's translated to well-formatted, standard 
CSS using the command line tool or a web-framework plugin.

Sass has two syntaxes. The new main syntax (as of Sass 3) is known as "SCSS" 
(for "Sassy CSS"), and is a superset of CSS's syntax. This means that every 
valid CSS stylesheet is valid SCSS as well. SCSS files use the extension .scss.
