## Front Controller

The front controller pattern is where you have a single entrance point for your 
web application (e.g. index.php) that handles all of the requests. This code is 
responsible for loading all of the dependencies, processing the request and 
sending the response to the browser. The front controller pattern can be 
beneficial because it encourages modular code and gives you a central place to 
hook in code that should be run for every request (such as input sanitization).
