##Bit manipulation <small>by using $bitMask objects</small>

A $bitMask Implements an collection of bits that grows as needed. The bits of a 
$bitMask are indexed by nonnegative integers. Individual indexed bits can be 
examined, set, or cleared. Additionally one $bitMask may be used to modify the 
contents of another $bitMask through the implemented logical AND, logical 
inclusive OR, and logical exclusive OR operations.
