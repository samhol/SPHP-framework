## INTRODUCTION

SPHP framework is an open source framework for developing interactive web applications
and services in object oriented PHP. 

This framework supports many aspects of full stack Web 
application development. Framework has all the web programming goodies (`PHP`-, `SQL`-, `CSS`-, `SCSS`- and `JavaScript`) under its hood, 
but generally deploying framework requires no usage of other programming languages than PHP.

The `SPHP` abreviation is a combination of my name `S`ami `P`etteri `H`olck and `P`HP: hypertext preprosessor.
      
## SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
