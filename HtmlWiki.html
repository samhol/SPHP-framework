			<p class="text-justify">HyperText Markup Language, commonly referred 
				to as HTML, is the standard markup language used to create web 
				pages. Web browsers can read HTML files and render them into 
				visible or audible web pages. HTML describes the structure of a 
				website semantically along with cues for presentation, making it 
				a markup language, rather than a programming language.</p>

		<div class="column small-12 medium-6 large-3">
			<p class="text-justify">
				HTML elements form the building blocks of all websites. HTML 
				allows images and objects to be embedded and can be used to 
				create interactive forms. It provides a means to create 
				structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text 
				such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other 
				items.</p>

		<div class="column small-12 medium-6 large-3">
			<p class="text-justify">The language is written in the form of HTML 
				elements consisting of tags enclosed in angle brackets (like 
				&lt;html&gt;). Browsers do not display the HTML tags and scripts, 
				but use them to interpret the content of the page.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="column small-12 medium-6 large-3">
			<p class="text-justify">HTML can embed scripts written in languages 
				such as JavaScript which affect the behavior of HTML web pages. 
				Web browsers can also refer to Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) to 
				define the look and layout of text and other material. The World 
				Wide Web Consortium (W3C), maintainer of both the HTML and the 
				CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit 
				presentational HTML since 1997.</p>
