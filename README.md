and services in object oriented PHP. SPHPlayground can be a part of full stack Web 
application development. Framework has many of the web programming goodies like `PHP`-, `SQL`-, `CSS`-, `SCSS`- and `JavaScript` under its hood, 
but generally deploying framework requires no usage of other programming languages than PHP.
